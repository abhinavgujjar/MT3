		The <a href=''> Big Lebowski is a 1998 American crime comedy film written, produced and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. It stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski, an unemployed Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler. After a case of mistaken identity, The Dude is introduced to a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski. When the millionaire Lebowski's trophy wife is kidnapped, he commissions The Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release. The plan goes awry when the Dude's friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) schemes to keep the full ransom. Julianne Moore and Steve Buscemi also star, with David Huddleston, John Turturro, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Tara Reid appearing in supporting roles. There is some narration at the beginning and towards the end by a cowboy known only as "The Stranger", played by Sam Elliott.</a>

				The film is loosely inspired by the work of Raymond Chandler. Joel Coen stated: "We wanted to do a Chandler kind of story – how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant".[2] The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen Brothers.

		The Dude meets his bowling friends, the timid Donny and the temperamental Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak. Encouraged by Walter, the Dude approaches the other Jeffrey Lebowski, a cantankerous elderly millionaire in a wheelchair, to seek compensation for his ruined rug. This request is promptly refused. He craftily steals one of Lebowski's rugs by telling Brandt, Lebowski's sycophantic assistant, that he was permitted to take a rug of his choice. The Dude subsequently meets Bunny, Lebowski's young nymphomaniacal trophy wife.

				Days later, Lebowski contacts the Dude stating that Bunny has been kidnapped. Lebowski wants the Dude to deliver a ransom and see if he can recognize the culprits. Later, a different pair of thugs appear in the Dude's apartment, knock him unconscious, and take Lebowski's rug. When Bunny's kidnappers call to arrange the ransom, Walter suggests they give the kidnappers a "ringer" briefcase filled with dirty laundry. The kidnappers grab the ringer and leave. Later that night, the Dude's car is stolen, with the ransom briefcase still inside.

				The Dude is forcibly brought before Treehorn, who demands the whereabouts of Bunny and the ransom. He drugs the Dude's White Russian cocktail, leading to an unconscious hallucinatory sequence involving Maude and bowling. The Dude comes to in police custody, where he is verbally and physically assaulted by the sheriff. During the cab ride home, the Dude gets thrown out after a trivial argument with the driver about The Eagles. A red sports car zooms past; Bunny is driving, with all her toes intact.

				The Dude finds his apartment completely trashed and is greeted by Maude, who seduces him. Afterwards, Maude says she hopes to conceive a child; the Dude protests the idea of being a father, but Maude assuages him in stating her intention the Dude have no hand in the child's upbringing. Maude also explains that her father has no money: her mother was the wealthy one and she left her money exclusively to the family charity. The Dude now understands the whole story: when Lebowski heard that Bunny was kidnapped, he withdrew money from the foundation for himself and gave an empty briefcase to the Dude. The kidnapping was also a ruse: when Bunny took an unannounced trip, her friends—the nihilists—purported a kidnapping to be able to extort money from Lebowski.
